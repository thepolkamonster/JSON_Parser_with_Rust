## JSON: 
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language

## Parser
In computer technology, a parser is a program that's usually part of a compiler. It receives input in the form of sequential source program instructions, interactive online commands, markup tags or some other defined interface.

In parsing, code is taken from the preprocessor, broken into smaller pieces and analyzed so other software can understand it. The parser does this by building a data structure out of the pieces of input.

This is project that i took up while learning the rust language, it is about:
